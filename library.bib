abstract = {The paper is concerned with the question: Can different kinds of emotions be influenced by tranquilizers which according to several theories (e.g., Gray, 1982) should only affect anxiety? In order to examine the kind of emotional effects of tranquilizers 144 female students received either 5 mg diazepam, 2 mg of the triazolobenzodiazepine GP 55129, or placebo and were then assigned to one of four conditions designed to induce anxiety, anger, happiness, or no emotional changes (neutral control). Self-reports of anxiety, anger, and elation were considered as indicators of specific emotional states; questionnaire measures of general excitement and of bodily arousal symptoms, heart rate, and blood pressure were regarded as indicators of nonspecific emotional changes. AN three emotion conditions induced increases in arousal which were most pronounced in the anxiety situation. The anxiety and the happiness situation but not the anger situation proved to be effective in inducing the intended specific emotion. Both drugs reduced self-reported anxiety in the anxiety situation. They did not affect self-reported elation in the happiness situation. Differences in the valence (positive versus negative) and in the intensity of the emotional changes induced by the happiness and the anxiety situation are discussed as possible reasons for the latter results.},

@article{Hertwig2001,
abstract = {This target article is concerned with the implications of the surprisingly different experimental practices in economics and in areas of psychology relevant to both economists and psychologists, such as behavioral decision making. We consider four features of experimentation in economics, namely, script enactment, repeated trials, performance-based monetary payments, and the proscription against deception, and compare them to experimental practices in psychology, primarily in the area of behavioral decision making. Whereas economists bring a precisely defined "script" to experiments for participants to enact, psychologists often do not provide such a script, leaving participants to infer what choices the situation affords. By often using repeated experimental trials, economists allow participants to learn about the task and the environment; psychologists typically do not. Economists generally pay participants on the basis of clearly defined performance criteria; psychologists usually pay a flat fee or grant a fixed amount of course credit. Economists virtually never deceive participants; psychologists, especially in some areas of inquiry, often do. We argue that experimental standards in economics are regulatory in that they allow for little variation between the experimental practices of individual researchers. The experimental standards in psychology, by contrast, are comparatively laissez-faire. We believe that the wider range of experimental practices in psychology reflects a lack of procedural regularity that may contribute to the variability of empirical findings in the research fields under consideration. We conclude with a call for more research on the consequences of methodological preferences, such as the use on monetary payments, and propose a "do-it-both-ways" rule regarding the enactment of scripts, repetition of trials, and performance-based monetary payments. We also argue, on pragmatic grounds, that the default practice should be not to deceive participants.},

abstract = {For tourism, the transformation into the experience economy means an increased demand for unique and unusual places to visit and activities to undertake; therefore it presents new challenges for tourism operators in developing innovative and memorable experience products in order of surviving in this new economy. This paper examines the notion of experiences and the commercialization of experiences into experience products. It investigates experience design and how tourism developers can design products that facilitate visitors’ positive outcomes. Several frameworks of optimal design of experiences have been proposed and this thesis has utilized two selected theoretical frameworks; the Four Experience Realms proposed by Pine and Gilmore (1999) as well as the Experience Pyramid (Tarssanen, 2009). The study follows exploratory and a descriptive research design in order of illustrating and applying the two frameworks to a nature-based tourism setting to identify gaps or conflict between theory and practice. Conclusively, a new framework for experience design within nature-based tourism is proposed.},

At the same time, despite advances, there are numerous dimensions of these leadership forms about which we still know very little. Given this moment in the field’s evolution, it is only appropriate that we take stock of where we have been and where we need to go into the future.Wetherefore provide an overview of the evolution of charismatic and transformational leadership in organizations. We examine progress along the following dimensions: 1) leader behaviors and their effects; 2) follower dispositions and dependency dynamics; 3) contextual factors; 4) institutionalization and succession forces; and 5) the liabilities of charismatic and transformational leaders.},

Whilst there has been an abundance of global media attention on sporting events such as the Olympics and World Football Cup, there seems to be a lack of integration between the sports marketing and international business disciplines both from a practical and also academic standpoint. This paper aims to discuss international sport marketing and why it is an important attribute of business-to-business marketing. Design/methodology/approach – The aim of the paper is to provide practical implications and research avenues for those seeking to further investigate international sport marketing as a unique area of academic research. The introduction to the paper focuses on the importance of sport to the global economy and how entrepreneurship is ingrained in many sport businesses and organizations. Next, different areas of international business management that relate to entrepreneurial sport marketing ventures are discussed in terms of future research directions and practical implications. These include how entrepreneurial sport ventures affect internationalization, branding, corporate social responsibility, tourism, regional development, marketing and action sports. Findings – The paper concludes by finding that there are numerous research avenues for future research on international sport marketing that combine different areas of marketing together with the sport marketing and international business literature. In addition, there is enormous potential for linking the sports marketing and international business literature through focusing on entrepreneurial sport ventures that occur worldwide. Research limitations/implications – The authors demonstrate the need to take an international perspective of sports marketing and business-to- business relationships. Practical implications – The paper discusses how and why sport firms interact in the international marketplace and how future competition will benefit from more sport-based business-to-business partnerships. Originality/value – The paper examines the important area of international sports marketing and how businesses that are both profit and non-profit orientated collaborate. The paper explores the concept of international sports marketing, and discusses the practical and future research implications of this exciting new field of marketing research.},

abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between shared leadership, as a collective within-team leadership, and innovative behavior, as well as antecedents of shared leadership in terms of team compo- sition and vertical transformational and empowering leadership. Design/Methodology/Approach Data were obtained from a field sample of 43 work teams, comprising 184 team members and their team leaders from two different com- panies. Team leaders rated the teams’ innovative behavior and their own leadership; team members provided infor- mation on their personality and their teams’ shared leadership. Findings Shared and vertical leadership, but not team composition, was positively associated with the teams’ level of innovative behavior. Vertical transformational and empowering leadership and team composition in terms of integrity were positively related to shared leadership. Implications Understanding how organizations can enhance their own innovation is crucial for the organiza- tions’ competitiveness and survival. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of teams, as work arrangements in organizations, raises the question of how to successfully manage teams. This study suggests that organizations should facilitate shared leadership which has a positive association with innovation. Originality/Value This is one of the first studies to pro- vide evidence of the relationship between shared leadership and innovative behavior, an important organizational out- come. In addition, the study explores two important predictors of shared leadership, transformational and empowering leadership, and the team composition in respect to integrity. While researchers and practitioners agree that shared leadership is important, knowledge on its antecedents is still in its infancy.},

Besides, we examined the effects of the moderating effects of social distance on transformational, transactional leadership and job satisfaction. Two hundred and sixty six employees from 43 electronic companies in Taiwan participated in this study. The results showed that transformational and transactional leadership had a significant positive relationship with task performance. Job satisfaction was a mediator of the relationship between transformational, transactional leadership and task performance. Finally, we found that social distance had negative moderating effects: When the degree of social distance was high, the positive relationship between transactional leadership and job satisfaction was weaker; on the other hand, when the degree of social distance was low, the negative relationship between transactional leadership style and task performance was stronger.. But social distance did not have significant moderating effects on transformational leadership.},

Yet, there is a small but growing body of conceptual work suggesting that our perception of someone as a leader is affected by his/her emotional abilities as well. This article develops a model proposing two distinct behavioral routes that influence perception of an individual as a leader in a small group. One route influences people to perceive leadership from displays of emotional abilities, such as empathy. The other route influences people to perceive leadership from displays of mental abilities, such as complex task performance. Our test of the hypothesized model using structural equation modeling showed a good fit and support for the proposed relationships.},

abstract = {The number of visitors choosing to visit the many national parks scattered around Germany is constantly on the increase, yet to date there have only been a few research undertakings into the social effects of tourism and outdoor recreation on these areas. With this in mind, we set out to investigate and identify the social effects of visitor crowding, as well as visitors’ expectations and satisfaction in one such national park; the Biosphere Reserve of the “Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer” on the island of Hallig Hooge. We feel that the findings of our study could be used by the local tourist management board as a guide for the implementation of future tourist management plans for the area. In the survey, we identified and interviewed two different types of dayvisitors, namely guided and independent visitors. As well as these groups, overnight visitors constitute an ever increasing percentage of those visiting the reserve. Tourism is the main source of income for the local economy and consequently there are many different businesses catering for both visitor groups, each with their own economic objective. A visual approach was used to identify the factors which influence the levels of crowding as perceived by tourists to the area. Each person surveyed was asked to evaluate the acceptability of a number of use levels as depicted in five computer-edited photographs. The results show that nearly 20\% of the visitors reported some degree of crowding. So the majority of those interviewed found the level of tourist activity to be acceptable. The most sensitive visitor group were the non-guided dayvisitors, whereas guided visitors were much more tolerant of crowding. Otherweise perceptions of crowding seem to have had just only a slight impact on visitor satis - faction. As tourism is the main source of income for the local economy, our findings could be relevant for local businesses and for future tourist management planning in the area.},

This paper systematically examines published and unpublished qualitative research studies of UK children's and adults' reasons for participation and non-participation in sport and physical activity. The review covers peer reviewed and gray literature from 1990 to 2004. Papers were entered into review if they: aimed to explore the participants' experiences of sport and physical activity and reasons for participation or non-participation in sport and physical activity, collected information on participants who lived in the United Kingdom and presented data collected using qualitative methods. From >1200 papers identified in the initial search, 24 papers met all inclusion criteria. The majority of these reported research with young people based in community settings. Weight management, social interaction and enjoyment were common reasons for participation in sport and physical activity. Concerns about maintaining a slim body shape motivated participation among young girls. Older people identified the importance of sport and physical activity in staving off the effects of aging and providing a social support network. Challenges to identity such as having to show others an unfit body, lacking confidence and competence in core skills or appearing overly masculine were barriers to participation.},

abstract = {The cortical areas that represent affectively positive and negative aspects of touch were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by comparing activations produced by pleasant touch, painful touch produced by a stylus, and neutral touch, to the left hand. It was found that regions of the orbitofrontal cortex were activated more by pleasant touch and by painful stimuli than by neutral touch and that different areas of the orbitofrontal cortex were activated by the pleasant and painful touches. The orbitofrontal cortex activation was related to the affective aspects of the touch, in that the somatosensory cortex (SI) was less activated by the pleasant and painful stimuli than by the neutral stimuli. This dissociation was highly significant for both the pleasant touch (P < 0.006) and for the painful stimulus (P < 0.02). Further, it was found that a rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex was activated by the pleasant stimulus and that a more posterior and dorsal part was activated by the painful stimulus. Regions of the somatosensory cortex, including SI and part of SII in the mid-insula, were activated more by the neutral touch than by the pleasant and painful stimuli. Part of the posterior insula was activated only in the pain condition and different parts of the brainstem, including the central grey, were activated in the pain, pleasant and neutral touch conditions. The results provide evidence that different areas of the human orbitofrontal cortex are involved in representing both pleasant touch and pain, and that dissociable parts of the cingulate cortex are involved in representing pleasant touch and pain.},

It explores the foundations of economic impacts of such a network and focuses on underlying behavioural responses of cyclists and their spending. The paper develops a model of expenditure on the basis of 383 travel diaries. The findings confirm that incomes, group sizes and durations of activity are integrally linked determinants of expenditure. The expenditures and durations of cycle trips are linked to preferences for longer journeys. This has implications for planners of routes to attract all types of cyclists from the most casual leisure trip to racing cyclists. Furthermore, the research findings infer that as extra-network and intra-network tourism groups cycling on the network do not behave differently they therefore should both be targeted by sports and tourism agencies.},

This study investigated the influ- ence of errors on perceptions of leader competence, effectiveness, and desire to work for the leader. It also examined the effects of gendered expectations on percep- tions of male and female leader errors by investigating the interactions that occur between the leaders gender, the type of error, and the occupational context. Design/Methodology A sample of 284 undergraduates read a series of fictional employee emails describing a leaders behavior and responded to several measures while envisioning themselves as subordinates of the leader. Findings Results suggested task and relationship errors exert damaging and differential effects on perceptions of leader task and relationship competence, respectively, and equally damage desire to work for the leader. Male leaders were perceived as less task and relationship competent, desirable to work for, and effective than female leaders for committing errors in a masculinized domain. Implications This study suggests leader errors matter, and that current leadership models ought to be expanded to account more clearly for them. Moreover, it offers insight into the role of gendered expectations in determining per- ceptions of male and female leader errors.},

Participants individually worked on the task in the presence of two other commerce students (also experimental confederates) who demonstrated either high or low productivity on the task. Participants working under the charismatic leader, regardless of the directionality of group productivity norms, had high task performance, task adjustment, and adjustment to the leader and to the group. Participants working under the structuring leader and in the high productivity norm group reported higher task satisfaction and lower role conflict than participants working under the structuring leader and in the low productivity norm group.

abstract = {Companies invest millions of dollars to become “official sponsors” of major global sporting events. The tremendous publicity and consumer audiences generated by such events provide an attractive marketing opportunity for companies other than the event’s official sponsors who seek to associate themselves in the minds of the public with the goodwill and popularity of these events. This activity, known as ambush marketing, poses significant legal and business challenges for sport event organizers seeking to protect both the financial investment of official sponsors and the integrity of their sponsorship programs. With rising sponsorship stakes, event organizers have become increasingly proactive in their efforts to combat ambush marketing. This article examines the implementation and effectiveness of a variety of evolving sponsorship program protection strategies including: pre-event educa-tion and public relations initiatives; on-site policing tactics; contractual language in athlete participation and spectator ticket agreements; and the enactment and enforcement of special trademark protection legislation.},

@article{Humphrey2002,
abstract = {This article focuses heavily on overviewing and analyzing the seven articles in this special issue on emotions and leadership. The articles are discussed in terms of four key leadership issues. The first issue concerns the traits necessary for leadership. Empathy is shown to be an important variable that is central to both emotional intelligence and leadership emergence. The second issue concerns the relationship of emotions to the leadership process. It is argued that a key leadership function is to manage the emotions of group members, especially with regard to feelings related to frustration and optimism. The third issue involves our perceptions about leaders. Leaders' emotional displays are demonstrated to have a larger impact on perceptions of leaders than the content of the leaders' messages, at least in some circumstances. The fourth area involves the relationship between leadership and performance. Leaders' influences upon emotional process variables are found to have a large impact on performance. The article develops several propositions that summarize the content of this special issue and, in addition, develops new propositions that suggest future areas of research. The article concludes by touching on the review process and acknowledges the reviewers for this special issue.},

abstract = {The issue related to public investment in sport facilities has generated lively debate between economists, researchers, and policy makers. Empirical evidence detailing benefits derived from such initiatives has become mired in the discus- sion of whether sports stadiums do serve as economic catalysts. Research has demonstrated that new stadiums and are- nas have no significant fiduciary impact on local economies, including employment. However, a possibility not fully explored is the idea that stadiums and teams generate both tangible and intangible benefits that can support the justi- fication for some level of public investment. Consequently, the contingent valuation method (CVM) has been employed by sport researchers for the purpose of measuring benefits accrued from such investments. However, the CVM is the most controversial of the non-market valuation methods and subject to a number of methodological crit- icisms. This article will explore the CVM beyond the scope of traditional economic impact studies and highlight its use and relevance in the sport management discourse.},

Seventy-two female subjects, preselected on role-playing ability, were asked to imagine situations of fear, sadness, anger, and joy. Emotional involvement was assessed through self-reports and physiological responses. Situations of sadness were the easiest to imagine, followed by anger, joy, and fear. Although there were some commonalities in the strategies subjects used to become involved, there also were sigdcant differences as a function of the particular emotion imagined. Finally, good role-players showed greater physiological reactivity during emotional imag- ery than did poor role-players.},

How has research addressed the multi-level complexities inherent in the phenomenon of diversity? For each question, we consider the strengths and weaknesses of recent diversity research, point out opportunities for new research, and identify threats to continued advancement. The review concludes by considering practical implications of the accumulated evidence.},

Data were gathered via questionnaire from coaches in 48 NCAA Division IA football coaching staffs (235 coaches). Hierarchical regression analyses, controlling for the success of the team and the number of respondents per team, indicated that the block of diversity vari- ables accounted for 18\% (p < .05) of the variance in occupational commit- ment and 16\% (p < .05) of the variance in occupational turnover intentions. Tenure and ethnic diversity were significant predictors in both analyses, al- though age diversity was not. Implications are discussed in relation to the complexity of diversity and strategies to mitigate the negative effects of group diversity on group-level outcomes.},

abstract = {Chemosensory communication of anxiety is a common phenomenon in vertebrates and improves perceptual and responsive behaviour in the perceiver in order to optimize ontogenetic survival. A few rating studies reported a similar phenomenon in humans. Here, we investigated whether subliminal face perception changes in the context of chemosensory anxiety signals. Axillary sweat samples were taken from 12 males while they were waiting for an academic examination and while exercising ergometric training some days later. 16 subjects (eight females) participated in an emotional priming study, using happy, fearful and sad facial expressions as primes (11.7 ms) and neutral faces as targets (47 ms). The pooled chemosensory samples were presented before and during picture presentation (920 ms). In the context of chemosensory stimuli derived from sweat samples taken during the sport condition, subjects judged the targets significantly more positive when they were primed by a happy face than when they were primed by the negative facial expressions (P = 0.02). In the context of the chemosensory anxiety signals, the priming effect of the happy faces was diminished in females (P = 0.02), but not in males. It is discussed whether, in socially relevant ambiguous perceptual conditions, chemosensory signals have a processing advantage and dominate visual signals or whether fear signals in general have a stronger behavioural impact than positive signals.},

abstract = {This study investigates aspects of host perception for the formulation of strategic tourism policies. A community segmentation framework with cluster analysis and multinomial logit model was applied to data of a mountain community in northern Italy to reveal the heterogeneity of residents’ perception. The results of this study refl ect the overall opinions of the sample population and identify homogeneous opinion groups. Positive and negative perceptions about tourism in the region generate a division of residents in environmental supporters, development supporters, protectionist and ambivalent. This study identifi es the effect of demographic variation on the clusters and on residents’ attitudes towards tourism.},

abstract = {A model was examined which proposes that employee influence tactics impact human resource decisions by affecting managers' perceptions of the subordinate's interpersonal skills, manager liking of subordinates, and managers' perceptions of similarity to subordinates. The human resource decisions investigated were performance ratings, promotability assessments, and salary. Data were collected from 247 subordinates and their managers and from company records. Structural equation modeling results indicated that influence tactics were related to managers' perceptions of subordinates' interpersonal skills, liking, and perceptions of similarity to subordinates. Specifically, subordinates' use of reasoning, assertiveness, and favor rendering were positively related to managers' perceptions whereas bargaining and self-promotion were negatively related to these perceptions. Finally, there was no support for direct relationships between influence tactics and HR decisions.},

With this five-in-one approach, the authors test the relative strengths of the four measurement methods, using REAL as the benchmark, on the basis of statistical criteria and decision-relevant metrics. The results indicate that the BDM and ICBC approaches can pass statistical and decision-oriented tests. The authors find that respondents are more price sensitive in incentive-aligned settings than in non-incentive-aligned settings and the REAL setting. Furthermore, they find a large number of “none” choices under ICBC than under hypothetical conjoint analysis. This study uncovers an intriguing possibility: Even when the OE format and CBC analysis generate hypothetical bias, they may still lead to the right demand curves and right pricing decisions.},

abstract = {We argue that Labor Market Segmentation theory is a good alternative to standard views of the labor market. Since it is sometimes argued that labor market segmentation theory is untestable, we first consider the uses of theory and the attributes of a good theory. We then argue that labor market segmentation has these attributes. It is internally consistent and is based on plausible assumptions about behavior and technology. More significantly, many of the predictions of the theory have been tested and confiied. Further, from a dynamic view the theory has done quite well. When the theory has suggested new tests, far more often tban not the predictions have been validated. Labor market segmentation theory has had to make little recourse to post-hoc explanations for unexpected empirical results. In contrast, human capital theory has required a series of post-hoc rationalizations to explain a large and growing body of empirical work motivated by the labor market segmentation perspective. Finally, we consider the implications of labor market segmentation theory for the practice of labor economics. We argue that further exploration of the implications of the theory for unemployment, trade. industiial policy and income distiibution will provide useful insights and fuither tests of tbe theory.},

This study has used the Self-Reported Habit Index of Verplanken and Orbell (2003) to measure habit strength in 23 statements concerning travel decision making. The four sub- decisions of particular interest in this study were; where and when to go on vacation, what to do, as well as how to travel to the chosen destination. The developed instrument unfolds a well recognized structure of travel behavior, results which validate the statements of SRHI and its applicability to the field of tourism. This research adds to the field of travel decision making by emphasizing the possibility to identify sub-decisions that are made out of habit and to use habit as a platform for tourist segmentation.},

Two hundred andfifty effects of the experimental induction ofpositive, elated and negative, depressed mood in adult, non- clinical samples were integrated. Effect sizes were generally larger for negative than for positive mood inductions. Thepresentation of afilm or story turnedout to be most effective in inducing both positive and negative mood states. The effects are especially large when subjects are explicitly instructed to enter the specified mood state. For elated mood, all other MIPs yielded considerably lower effectiveness scores. For the induction of negative mood states, Imagination, Velten, Music. Social Interaction and Feedback MIPs were about as effective as the Film/Story MIP without instruction. Induction effects covaried with several study characteristics. Effects tend to be smaller when demand characteristics are controlled or subjects are not informed about the purpose of the experiment. For behavioural measures, effects are smaller than for self-reports but still larger than zero. Hence, the effects of MIPS can be partly, but not fully due to \&mand effects.},

abstract = {The difficulty of measuring the prevalence of doping in elite sport is a recurring topic in the scientific literature on doping. The Randomized Response Technique is a method for asking such embarrassing or even threatening questions while allowing the respondents to answer honestly. It was used to measure the prevalence of doping among German squad athletes by Pitsch et al. (2005, 2007). In a replication study with better sampling control, it was possible to replicate the general trend of the data from the 2005 study. Nevertheless, there are differences in the details between the two sets of findings. An additional explorative analysis reveals that gender has an important impact on doping decisions. Most theories of doping, especially those derived from systems theory or economic game theory address neither the central findings nor the influence of gender. Based on these findings, we will discuss questions of theory development in relation to empirical evidence.},

abstract = {Most previous neurophysiological studies evoked emotions by presenting visual stimuli. Models of the emotion circuits in the brain have for the most part ignored emotions arising from musical stimuli. To our knowledge, this is the first emotion brain study which examined the influence of visual and musical stimuli on brain processing. Highly arousing pictures of the International Affective Picture System and classical musical excerpts were chosen to evoke the three basic emotions of happiness, sadness and fear. The emotional stimuli modalities were presented for 70 s either alone or combined (congruent) in a counterbalanced and random order. Electroencephalogram (EEG) Alpha-Power-Density, which is inversely related to neural electrical activity, in 30 scalp electrodes from 24 right-handed healthy female subjects, was recorded. In addition, heart rate (HR), skin conductance responses (SCR), respiration, temperature and psychometrical ratings were collected. Results showed that the experienced quality of the presented emotions was most accurate in the combined conditions, intermediate in the picture conditions and lowest in the sound conditions. Furthermore, both the psychometrical ratings and the physiological involvement measurements (SCR, HR, Respiration) were significantly increased in the combined and sound conditions compared to the picture conditions. Finally, repeated measures ANOVA revealed the largest Alpha-Power-Density for the sound conditions, intermediate for the picture conditions, and lowest for the combined conditions, indicating the strongest activation in the combined conditions in a distributed emotion and arousal network comprising frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital neural structures. Summing up, these findings demonstrate that music can markedly enhance the emotional experience evoked by affective pictures.},

At an empirical level, irrelevant thoughts were defined as thoughts that did not facilitate successful task performance. We used the same general procedure for both experiments: three groups of college students received happy-, neutral-(control), or sad-mood inductions and performed a memory task. The procedure for obtaining thoughts varied between experiments. The subjects in Experiment 1 listed their thoughts after the memory recall task. In Experiment 2, the subjects were tape-recorded while performing a memory task and producing concurrent verbal protocols. The subjects in both experiments then judged their thoughts in terms of frequency, intensity, and irrelevance. We found a similar pattern of results in both experiments: (1) The proportions of irrelevant thoughts and recall performance were negatively related, and (2) happy and sad students produced reliably greater proportions of irrelevant thoughts than did neutral (control) students.},

They run separate estimates for men and women using the Spanish Time-Use Survey conducted in 2002-2003. The results show that there are gender differences in the determinants of the allocation of time to physical activity. Moreover, participation in physical activity and sports and the time devoted to these activities seem to be based on different decisions.},

@article{Fredrickson2004,
abstract = {The broaden-and-build theory describes the form and function of a subset of positive emotions, including joy, interest, contentment and love. A key proposition is that these positive emotions broaden an individual's momentary thought-action repertoire: joy sparks the urge to play, interest sparks the urge to explore, contentment sparks the urge to savour and integrate, and love sparks a recurring cycle of each of these urges within safe, close relationships. The broadened mindsets arising from these positive emotions are contrasted to the narrowed mindsets sparked by many negative emotions (i.e. specific action tendencies, such as attack or flee). A second key proposition concerns the consequences of these broadened mindsets: by broadening an individual's momentary thought-action repertoire--whether through play, exploration or similar activities--positive emotions promote discovery of novel and creative actions, ideas and social bonds, which in turn build that individual's personal resources; ranging from physical and intellectual resources, to social and psychological resources. Importantly, these resources function as reserves that can be drawn on later to improve the odds of successful coping and survival. This chapter reviews the latest empirical evidence supporting the broaden-and-build theory and draws out implications the theory holds for optimizing health and well-being.},

We begin by examining authentic leadership and its development, followed by work that takes a cognitive science approach. We then examine new-genre leadership theories, complexity leadership, and leadership that is shared, collective, or distributed. We examine the role of relationships through our review of leader member exchange and the emerging work on followership. Finally, we examine work that has been done on substitutes for leadership, servant leadership, spirituality and leadership, cross-cultural leadership, and e-leadership. This structure has the benefit of creating a future focus as well as providing an interesting way to examine the development of the field. Each section ends with an identification of issues to be addressed in the future, in addition to the overall integration of the literature we provide at the end of the article.},

abstract = {The fit between a sponsor and object (i.e., sponsored organization, cause, event, or individual) has been shown to be an important construct in predicting sponsorship effects, but little research has been done to understand the basis for fit perceptions. The current research uses three studies to find and test the underlying dimensions used to judge the degree of overall fit between a sponsor and object. Starting with an exploratory study that uses qualitative cognitive map-ping to uncover seven dimensions that form the basis for overall fit perceptions, a follow-up experiment determines their ability to predict overall fit and sponsorship-related attitude changes. The last study tests whether overall fit perceptions can be manipulated both positively and negatively with fit dimension–related communications about the sponsorship. The research finds that sponsor product relevance, attitude similarity, geographic similarity, audience similarity, and sponsor-ship duration significantly predict overall fit and/or can be used to manipulate fit perceptions positively.},

The use of cluster analysis presents a complex challenge because it requires several methodological choices that determine the quality of a cluster solution. This paper chronicles the application of cluster analysis in strategic management research, where the technique has been used since the late 1970s to investigate issues of central importance. Analysis of 45 published strategy studies reveals that the implementation of cluster analysis has been ofen less than ideal, perhaps detracting from the ability of studies to generate knowledge. Given these findings, suggestions are offered for improving the application of cluster analysis in future inquiry.},

Both emphasize that individuals face two distinct decisions: (1) should I participate; and (2) how much time should I spend participating? The results indicate that economic factors like income and opportunity cost of time are important determinants of physical activity and that physical activity is a normal good. Individual char- acteristics also play an important role in determining the amount of time spent in physical activity. Participation and time spent decline with age. Females, married people, households with children, blacks and hispanics all spend less time engaged in physical activity than males, single people, childless households and whites. Public policy interventions aimed at improving physical activity of Americans targeted to specific sub-populations are likely to be more effective than broad-based policies.},

abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between board performance and board–executive relationships within voluntary sport organisations. Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 21 executives, board chairs and board members from seven voluntary sport organisations. Results revealed that four elements of the board–executive relationship were perceived to be associated with effective board performance. These elements included board leadership, trust between the board and the executive, the control of information available to the board, and responsibility for board performance. The paper explores each of these elements, and the implications for governing boards of voluntary sport organisations.},

abstract = {Sport tourism is a new concept in the world having the most growth in tourism industry. Many countries enjoy an appropriate status with respect to sport tourism and, accordingly, contribute directly to their nation’s economic prosperity. Hence, the goal of this research is to compare and survey tourism managers, interest managers and tourisms’ ideas about creation of sport tourism-induced employment and income in Mazandaran-Iran. The tool of this research is a researcher-made five scale likert questionnaire. The questionnaire reliability and the coefficient validity were confirmed by experienced professors and with ( = 0.82), respectively. Finally, the data analysis was carried out using the SPSS software and 2 statistic test. The results showed that job creation (2 = 4.360, p = 0.35) and income production (2 = 1.633, p = 0.80) were previously at a minimum. However, the role of tourism industry development is believed to create jobs (2 = 9.740, p = 0.04) and income (2 = 5.224, p = 0.51). When compared with other studies, the present research indicates that future sport tourism industry influences job and income production in the regions hosting the sport events provided that the sport tourism industry and its respective infrastructures are well-developed.},

An empirical study using an online survey was conducted among key managers involved in sponsoring football clubs in the Netherlands. This study develops a formative measure of sponsorship, termed the Sport Sponsorship Index, and links this measure with brand equity. Results indicate that the var-ious facets ofa sport sponsorship package, such as exposure of the brand and coverage of the sport, are per-ceived by sponsors to contribute differently to the impact on brand equity. Within sponsorship negotiation, these findings assist all parties in understanding the relative importance of the elements ofa sponsorship in fulfilling brand-related objectives. By constructing and validating an adequate scale of the key components incorporated into a sponsorship package, we provide sport administrators with item level diagnostics which can contribute to improving their sponsorship offering.},

abstract = {Purpose We investigated the convergence and divergence perspectives in organizations to determine whether certain leadership competencies are universally endorsed by managers across countries (supporting convergence) as being important for success in organizations, or if the importance of the leadership competencies were dependent upon certain cultural dimensions (supporting divergence). Design/Methodology/Approach Participants were 9,942 practicing managers in 40 countries. Because managers were nested within their respective countries and endorsement was a binary outcome variable, a special case of multilevel analysis known as a hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM) was used. Findings Findings support cross-national convergence: Resourcefulness, Change Management, and Building and Mending Relationships were highly valued among managers across countries, and cultural values did not seem to influence this endorsement. Balancing Personal Life and Work was not as valued globally. Implications Researchers must investigate leadership competencies that are important to organizational success across countries. Due to globalization, it is vital that managers become aware of the values espoused within their organization as well as among their business partners and contemporaries. This may facilitate cross-national business interaction and leader effectiveness. Originality/Value This study advances theory in its attempt to empirically examine whether leadership competencies needed to succeed in organizations are universally endorsed. Moreover, the sample of managers utilized was unique and extremely robust. The study offers methodological advances as well; it is one of the few examples of the appropriate use of a special case of multilevel data analysis that enables the use of a binary outcome measure.},

abstract = {Social impacts of hosting major sport events have gained interest among event researchers. This study contributes to this line of inquiry by assessing the impact of the arrival of a stage of the 2007 Tour de France in Ghent. Residents’ perceptions of impacts were measured by using a pre- and post design, generating 396 and 235 valid questionnaires respectively. Exploratory factor analysis revealed seven impact factors. Overall, residents’ perceptions of impacts have changed over time. The most highly perceived benefits in the pre- and post- test were cultural and image benefits, whereas the most highly perceived costs were excessive spending and mobility problems. The impact factors ‘‘cultural interest and consolidation’’ and ‘‘excessive spending and mobility problems’’ were significant predictors of residents’ willingness to host the event in the future. Results suggest that developing a strategy of maximizing positive and minimizing negative impacts might be beneficial for obtaining social leverage.},

abstract = {Prior research has suggested and found evidence for an event's image being transferred to a brand because of sponsorship activity. This study builds on prior work by examining how the image transfer process is impacted by spectators' level of identification and the degree to which the sponsor and event are perceived to be logically connected (event-sponsor fit). Further, the impact of image transfer on sponsorship related behavioral intentions is assessed. Using two contexts and nine different sponsors our results indicate that high levels of identification and a logical event-brand fit serve to increase image transfer perceptions. Image transfer is also found to predict intentions to purchase fiom event sponsors. Managerial implications and directions for future research are discussed.},

abstract = {Non-profit sport clubs face several challenges including those relating to human resources, financial capabilities, networks and infrastructural elements. In order for clubs to realise their capacity to respond to encountered challenges, it is imperative for club executives and sport federations to have an improved understanding of the clubs resource structure and ability to deploy resources. Drawing on the concept of organisational capacity as well as Resource Dependency Theory, the objectives of this study are to provide empirical evidence of the resources of non-profit sport clubs and to show that these clubs are characterised by scarce resources. A large sport club survey in Germany (n = 13,068) was used as the data set for this study. The results indicate that sport clubs seem to have organisational capacity, as they have many different types of resources at their disposal that which can be ascribed to four capacity dimensions. The analysis of longitudinal data reveals changes in resources that indicate particularly human resources (volunteers) and infrastructure resources become more scarce over the course of time.},

abstract = {This paper considers how the Internet can be used to leverage commercial sponsorships to enhance audience attitudes toward the sponsor. Definitions are offered that distinguish the terms lever- age and activation with respect to sponsorship-linked marketing; leveraging encompasses all marketing communications collateral to the sponsorship investment, whereas activation relates to those communications that encourage interaction with the sponsor. Although activation in many instances may be limited to the immediate event-based audience, leveraging sponsorships via sponsors’ Web sites enables activation at the mass-media audience level. Results of a Web site navigation experiment demonstrate that activational sponsor Web sites promote more favorable attitudes than do nonactivational Web sites. It is also shown that sponsor- sponsee congruence effects generalize to the online environment, and that the effects of sponsorship articulation on audience atti- tudes are moderated by the commerciality of the explanation for the sponsor-sponsee relationship. Importantly, the study reveals that attitudinal effects associated with variations in leveraging, congru- ence, and orientation of articulation may be sustained across time.},

abstract = {It is commonly believed that managers have shared understandings of espoused organizational values. However, some researchers have argued that organizational members, including managers, have multiple, conflicting, or ambiguous interpretations of organizational values that may complicate the process of translating values into practices (Martin, 1992; Meyerson, 1991a; Young, 1989). The purpose of this study was to examine the meanings sport managers associate with the organizational value of gender equity for athletes using an analytic framework developed by Martin (1992, 2001). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five administrators in one university athletic department. A document analysis of policies and budgets and observations were additional data sources. The findings revealed that administrators offered multiple meanings of gender equity and that those meanings were underpinned by confusion, contradictions, and silences, supporting the differentiation and fragmentation perspectives proposed by Martin (1992, 2001). By relying on dominant narratives, managers sometimes fail to notice other ways of matching organizational practices with espoused organizational values.},

abstract = {Customer satisfaction and loyalty are key drivers of performance. However, there is increasing evidence that good attribute performance and high overall satisfaction do not always automatically lead to higher loyalty. In this paper, we put forward a study on customer satisfaction and loyalty to Alpine ski resorts. We analyse the moderating effects of three important factors in the attribute performance–overall satisfaction–loyalty relationship: lifestyle, consumer spending and customers’ skiing skills in a sample of 6172 skiers. The results show that all studied variables have a moderating effect. The findings have implications on both theory and practice.},

abstract = {Researchers interested in emotion have long struggled with the problem of how to elicit emotional responses in the laboratory. In this article, we summarise five years of work to develop a set of films that reliably elicit each of eight emotional states (amusement, anger, contentment, disgust, fear, neutral, sadness, and surprise). After evaluating over 250 films, we showed selected film clips to an ethnically diverse sample of 494 English-speaking subjects. We then chose the two best films for each of the eight target emotions based on the intensity and discreteness of subjects' responses to each film. We found that our set of 16 films successfully elicited amusement, anger, contentment. disgust, sadness, surprise, a relatively neutral state, and, to a lesser extent, fear. We compare this set of films with another set recently described by Philippot (1993), and indicate that detailed instructions for creating our set of film stimuli will be provided on request.},

Using a de- tailed mail survey (N= 407, response rate = 26.7\%), a cate- gorization indicating four planning levels was devised: nonplanners, short-term planners, short- and long-term planners, and long-term planners. Attractions with greater levels of planning were shown to have higher levels of per- ceived performance and faced the future with better growth prospects and business confidence. They also reported higher management turnover. Attraction research, it was ar- gued, needs to develop with studies from different regions and histories to test the value of specific findings. In addition, multimethod approaches are needed to disentangle causality issues linking planning and attraction characteristics.},

Moderator variables suggested by the literature, including level of the leader (high or low), organizational setting (public or private), and operationalization of the criterion measure (subordinate perceptions organizational measures of effectiveness), were empirically tested and found to have differential impacts on collations between leader style and effectiveness. The operationalization of the criterion variable emerged as a powerful moderator. Unanticipated findings for type of organization and level of the leader are explored regarding the frequency of transformational leader behavior and relationships with effectiveness.},

abstract = {For more than 5000 years, people have cultivated flowers although there is no known reward for this costly behavior. In three different studies we show that flowers are a powerful positive emotion “inducer”. In Study 1, flowers, upon presentation to women, always elicited the Duchenne or true smile. Women who received flowers reported more positive moods 3 days later. In Study 2, a flower given to men or women in an elevator elicited more positive social behavior than other stimuli. In Study 3, flowers presented to elderly participants (55+ age) elicited positive mood reports and improved episodic memory. Flowers have immediate and long-term effects on emotional reactions, mood, social behaviors and even memory for both males and females. There is little existing theory in any discipline that explains these findings. We suggest that cultivated flowers are rewarding because they have evolved to rapidly induce positive emotion in humans, just as other plants have evolved to induce varying behavioral responses in a wide variety of species leading to the dispersal or propagation of the plants.},

Good theory does not just describe, it explains. Thus, in a fundamentally applied field like sport management it is important that the body of knowledge is derived from theory-based and theory- building research. It is equally important that practice and student learning is founded on good theory that guides explanation, prediction and effective management of the sport enterprise. The paper focuses particularly on how, as scholars, we can invest in theory through research, whether it is borrowing, adapting, and extending theory from other disciplines, or generating new theory within sport management that is intentionally relevant to the field.},

abstract = {The interests of the organization and its members need to be aligned. Such is a task for the transformational leader. In contrast to the transactional leader who practises contingent reinforcement of followers, the transformational leader inspires, intellectually stimulates, and is individually considerate of them. Transformational leadership may be directive or participative. Requiring higher moral development, transformational leadership is recognized universally as a concept. Furthermore, contrary to earlier expectations, women leaders tend to be more transformational than their male counterparts. Although a six-factor model of transformational/ transactional leadership best fits a diversity of samples according to confirmatory factor analyses, whether fewer factors are necessary remains an open question. Another important research question that has only been partially answered is why transformational leadership is more effective than transactional leadership in a wide variety of business, military, industrial, hospital, and educational circumstances.

abstract = {Recent developments (e.g., cut of public subsidies, demographic change, changes in sport demand) can lead to decreasing revenues in non-profit sport clubs. They could be in part compensated by increasing revenues from membership fees. In general, member- ship fees in sport clubs can be regarded as moderately high. Members‟ sensitivity to increasing membership fees was not investigated until now. The aim of the study is to forecast members‟ responses to increasing membership fees with the help of price elas- ticity simulations and to find out determinants of (relative) willingness-to-pay. There- fore a theoretical of price elasticity in sport clubs was developed which is based on Becker‟s (1965) household theory and the construct of consumption capital. By means of a written and electronic survey active, adult members in 21 sports (N=10,013) were asked about their willingness-to-pay for the membership. With the help of willingness- to-pay price elasticities were simulated. The results show that members pay an average membership fee of 148 € per year and willingness-to-pay for it is about 100 \% higher. Simulated price elasticities show that members would be very price sensitive to in- creases in membership fees up to 13 \% because of an elastic demand. Demand would be unit-elastic at an increase of 14 \% and would respond inelastically to increases of 15 \% and more. With regard to price elasticity, differences among sports have to be consid- ered. All in all the critical point for increasing membership fees seems to be between increases of 10 \% and 25 \%. The theoretical model was tested with the help of regres- sion analyses. Regarding all sports, willingness-to-pay is determined significantly by income, sport expenditures, proportion of membership fee of total sport expenditures, years of participation, level of performance, weekly time of participation, satisfaction, and identification with the sport club. The income effect is the strongest effect. Differ- ences among sports were again found out. The results show that members are very het- erogeneous with regard to their membership fees and their willingness-to-pay. Sport clubs should attach importance to an adequate communication in case of an intended increase of membership fees and take differences among sports into account.},

abstract = {Purpose This study explores whether follower perceived need-supply (N-S) job fit, demand-ability (D-A) job fit, and person-organization (P-O) fit mediate the relationships between individual-level, unit-level transformational leadership (TFL), and follower task performance. Design/Methodology/Approach Data were collected from multiple sources, comprised 85 leaders and 343 followers in 85 bank branches. Hierarchical linear modeling analysis (HLM) was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings Our results indicate that both individual-level and unit-level TFL positively predict follower task performance. In addition, follower N-S and D-A job fit perceptions mediate the association between individual-level TFL and task performance. However, follower P-O fit perception did not mediate the unit-level TFL-performance linkage. Implications Our results show that: (1) TFL is positively related to follower task performance; (2) TFL is positively associated with follower N-S and D-A job fit perceptions; and (3) follower perceived fit with their job (e.g., N-S and D-A job fit) positively predicts their task performance. Originality/Value Leadership researchers have attempted to clarify the mechanisms linking TFL and follower task performance. However, whether follower fit perceptions toward the job and the organization explain this association has been neglected in past studies. This study contributes to the leadership and fit literature by examining the mediating roles of follower perceived N-S job fit, D-A job fit, and P-O fit within the TFL-follower task performance link.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method for systematically incorporating the study of consumer preferences or utility judgements in health promotion program development research. It illustrates an attempt to integrate the science of consumer behavior with the science of health behavior modification, toward the end of utility-responsive health promotion. A method that appears to be particularly useful in the investigation of health promotion program consumer utility judgements is conjoint analysis. Conjoint analysis facilitates evaluation of consumer response to program features or attributes when they are considered jointly, rather than one at a time. It can be used to conduct program concept testing, or assessment of preference for diverse combinations of program attributes in various consumer groups. It thus aids in tailor fitting an intervention to specific segments of targeted populations, and in developing promotional materials. None the less, a literature search failed to reveal any applications of conjoint analysis to health promotion program develop- ment research. This paper briefly describes conjoint analysis and the potential benefits of its application in this area. A heuristic framework for applying conjoint analysis to health promotion program development is delineated, based on procedures followed during formative work on a smoking cessation program. Four stages of program development are outlined.},

Several analytical procedures have been depicted to operate with fuzzy techniques, which may be applied to empirical research by a wide range of researchers in the sport literature, as well as sport managers. This study showed that fuzzy logic is an attractive method to increase the value of the information collected from custom- ers’ evaluations. The implemented procedure overcomes the disadvantages of the research focused on the third-person approach, and minimizes the categorization bias and interaction bias derived from the relationship between verbal and numeri- cal labels. An empirical study of two samples of consumers from two fitness centers illustrates the advantages of this method.},

The degree of bodily arousal was varied by disguised oral administration of a placebo or the sympathicomimetic agent ephedrine. The situational circumstances were varied by instruc- tions offering cues for (a) no emotions ('neutral' control), or the feeling states called (b) 'anger', (c) 'happiness', and (d) 'anxiety'. The subjects were 72 male students. The dependent variables were blood pressure, heart rate, a list of bodily sYmptoms, and an adjective cheek list. The results within the 'anger' and 'happiness' condition were in accordance with Schachtea's theory: depending on the type of situation, ephedrine-induced arousal either decreased or increased positive descriptions of mood. The emotional effects of the 'anxiety' condition, however, were independent of the drug-induced arousal level. Contrary to Schachter's theory, anxiety reac- tions oecured also in a state of low physiological arousal and did not increase with increasing arousal.},

A case study of the 2005 Fdration Internationale de Natation (FINA) World Aquatics Championships was built by means of interviews and archival material, using a multi-stakeholder perspective. Findings highlighted that core elements of upper-management level leadership in events were best described by the multiple-linkage leadership theory, which includes task commitment, ability and role clarity, work organization, cooperation and mutual trust, resources and support, and external coordination as the six intervening variables. While charismatic and transformational leadership styles surfaced as contributing to the overall success of an event, the multiple-linkage leadership theory offered a more comprehensive understanding of leadership in major sporting events from a multi-stakeholder perspective.},

@article{Humphreys2010,
abstract = {Corporate sponsorship of sports, causes, and the arts has become a mainstream communications tool worldwide. The unique marketing opportunities associated with major events also attract nonsponsoring companies seeking to form associations with the event (ambushing). There are strategies available to brands and events which have been ambushed; however, there is only limited information about the effects of those strategies on attainment of sponsorship objectives. In Experiment 1, university staff and students participated by studying paragraphs linking a sponsor to a novel event. Relative to each sponsor-event pair, they then studied one of three different messages about a competitor. Results find a message which linked the competitor and the event increased competitor recall given the event as a cue and event recall given the competitor as a cue. These effects were moderated if there was information about the competitor not being the sponsor. In Experiment 2 ambushing and counter-ambushing information was presented over 2 days. Both types of messages increased competitor recall given the event as a cue and event recall given the competitor as a cue. In addition, "not sponsor" information was not always used even when it should have been recallable. The results can be explained if participants are using three cues: a specific cue such as a brand name, a contextual cue, and a category cue, such as the concept of an event. Findings suggest to sponsoring firms and event properties that counter-ambushing communications may have the unintended effect of strengthening an ambusher-event relationship in memory.},

This paper provides a detailed review of this literature. It focuses on papers that have been published in economics journals since 1990, as well as some key reviews in psychology and important unpublished working papers. The evidence suggests that poor health, separation, unemployment and lack of social contact are all strongly negatively associated with SWB. However, the review highlights a range of problems in drawing firm conclusions about the causes of SWB; these include some contradictory evidence, concerns over the impact on the findings of potentially unobserved variables and the lack of certainty on the direction of causality. We should be able to address some of these problems as more panel data become available.},

It was found that leadership within voluntary sport organization boards emanates from either board chairs or executives and that when the individuals fulfilling these roles are able to develop a mature working rela- tionship, the board’s ability to perform is enhanced. These find- ings extend our understanding of the importance of leadership roles held by volunteers and paid professionals for the achieve- ment of organizational outcomes.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between selected leadership behaviors (transformational and transactional) and attitudes toward selected inclusive practices (behavioral and social) for students with disabilities. Determining how transformational and transactional leadership behaviors are related to principals’ attitudes toward inclusive practices is needed because such understanding will assist administrators and other professionals in deciding what type of leader is best suited for leading inclusive schools. There are few studies related to administrators’ leadership behaviors and their attitudes toward inclusion in any form. The results of this study provide an opportunity to examine North Carolina principals’ leadership behaviors as well as their attitudes toward inclusive practices. The results also prove beneficial to administrators and other professionals who are working to better their currently existing inclusive programs or to generate new ones. In recent years, as a result of the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) mandate, American schools have seen an increase in students with disabilities being educated in the regular classroom, which is known as inclusion. This study used a one-group, correlational design, using two instruments. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (5x-short), Third Edition – Leader Form (MLQ) and the Attitudes Toward Inclusive Education Scale (ATIES) were mailed to 215 randomly selected middle school principals in North Carolina. The response rate was 49.7\%. The Pearson Product Moment Correlation was used to analyze the relationship between selected leadership behaviors (transformational and transactional) and attitudes toward selective inclusive practices (behavioral and social). Results from the study indicated that there was a significant relationship between transformational leadership behaviors and attitudes toward inclusive education for the sample of this study (r (75) = .320, p < .01). There was no significant relationship between transactional leadership behaviors and attitudes toward inclusive practices for the sample of this study (r (72) = -.068, p < .05). The findings of this study have indicated that further examination into the relationship between leadership behaviors and attitudes toward inclusive education is warranted to assist educators in making critical decisions about the type of leader that is best suited for leading inclusive schools, providing quality professional development to principals regarding inclusive culture, and making a significant contribution to existing literature on leadership and special education.

abstract = {Title sponsorships are often considered the crown jewels of sports sponsorship programs. Garnering top media coverage, title sponsorships are prized for both generating brand/product awareness and building image for their sponsors. Not surprisingly, the rising cost of title sponsorships has led some managers to question their underlying value. Accordingly, this study presents an analysis of the impact of 114 title sponsorship announcements of professional tennis and golf tournaments (both men’s and women’s), auto racing (NASCAR), and college bowl games on the stock prices of sponsoring firms. Overall, the results of the study suggest that title sponsorships are generally signed at market-clearing prices. Thus, companies undertaking title sponsorships typically receive exactly what they pay for—except in the case of NASCAR races (which show evidence of increases in share prices). Splitting the sample into new and renewing sponsorships generates results which differ dramatically by sport. Finally, a cross-sectional regression finds congruence of sport and sponsor, sponsorship by high tech firms and sponsorships by large firms all correlated with perceived sponsorship success.},

abstract = {Although enormous sums are spent on sport sponsorships, knowledge of sponsorship information processing is still limited. For a continuing growth of sponsorship as a field significant improvements in our understanding of sponsoring effectiveness are required. Whereas the direct effect of sponsor signage exposure on sponsor recall has been identified in several studies, attention to sponsor signage as the mediator of sponsorship infor- mation has not been investigated thoroughly. Based on spotlight theory and the associative network model of memory, the present paper addresses this research gap and investigates the viewer’s visual attention to sponsorship information by applying eye tracking methodology. Regression models have been estimated to analyze information reception and processing in sport telecasts. The results reveal that the capture of attention is determined by the placement of sponsor signage and by exposure variables. Furthermore, sponsor recall is found to be a function of attention and brand-related variables.},

abstract = {Data from 947 Division I college coaches in the United States were used to examine three hypotheses concerning the impact of gender ratio on the frequency of social interac- tion between women and men coaches. These hypotheses were based on (a) the structural perspective characterized by the politics of optimism, (b) the institutional approach associ- ated with the politics of pessimism, and (c) the common consciousness or subculture perspective represented by the politics of transcendence. Most support was shown for the politics of pessimism, which contends that an increase of women in a male-dominated occupation is associated with rising gender boundaries and sex segregation. Results are explored in the context of gendered homosociality.

@article{Pawlowski2011,
abstract = {As an attempt to measure the ‘experienced’ utility of individuals in economics, the investigation of individuals’ subjective well-being (SWB) was pioneered by Van Praag and Frijters (1999) and Kahneman et al. (1999). Since then, a number of studies has analysed the factors associated with SWB and policy makers are now recognis- ing the importance of SWB as a policy target, with the implication being that one could target its factors associated with increase in the overall SWB in countries. However, despite its significance to economies, and increasing policy relevance, investigations on the impact of sport and physical activity on SWB are relatively rare [e.g. Rasciute and Downward in Kyklos 63(2):256–270, 2010]. More specifically, despite sports participation and engagement in physical activity having a strong age-specific profile (Breuer et al. in Eur Rev Aging Phys Act 7:61–70, 2010; Hinrichs et al. in Eur J Sport Soc 6(1):49–57, 2010; Mechling and Netz in European Rev Aging Physical Activity 6(2):89–97, 2009), there is no study that inves- tigates whether the magnitude of this impact is age-specific. Consequently, this paper seeks to make a unique contribu- tion to the existing literature by exploring the age-specific effects of physical activity on SWB for a broad cross- section of 19 European countries. Overall, the results suggest that engagement in physical activity generally contributes to the SWB of individuals on a European level but that significant age-specific differences exist.},

Practice using these visual iconic symbols in decoding stories achieves effective storytelling learning via cognitive sculpting; that is, learning improves from moving and arranging (sculpting) potentially three-dimensional story or electronically movable icons while talking or writing narratives.},

abstract = {The influences of emotions on eating were investigated. One-hundred and seven female and 103 male subjects were asked to report how various characteristics of eating could change during the emotions of anger, fear, sadness and joy. Subjects completed a questionnaire of 33 items for each emotion and a food deprivation condition.Afactor analysis of the items answered with respect to food deprivation yielded four factors which were labelled hunger, impulsive eating, sensory eating and hedonic eating. ANCOVAs showed main effects of emotions upon each factor. Single comparisons showed that: (1) subjects reported to experience higher levels of hunger during anger and joy than during fear and sadness; (2) impulsive eating and sensory eating were rated higher during anger than during the other emotions; and (3) hedonic eating was rated higher during joy than during the other emotions. Results did not indicate any differential influences upon eating between fear and sadness. Women reported to experience higher tendencies of impulsive eating and sensory eating than men during anger and sadness. Eating scores of negative emotions correlated low and positive with body mass index, low and negative with dietary restraint. The differential effects of emotions on characteristics of eating may be due to differences of the examined emotions in frequency of occurrence, physiological correlates and motivational properties.},

abstract = {The effects of three different procedures, relaxation, visualization and yogic breathing and stretch (pranayama) on perceptions of physical and mental energy and on positive and negative mood states have been assessed in a group of normal volunteers (N = 71, age range 21-76). Pranayama produced a significantly greater increase in perceptions of mental and physical energy and feelings of alertness and enthusiasm than the other two procedures (P < 0.5). Relaxation made subjects significantly more sleepy and sluggish immediately after the session than pranayama (P < 0.05). Visualization made them more sluggish but less content than pranayama (P < 0.05) and more upset than relaxation after the second session (P < 0.05). Thus, a 30 min programme of yogic stretch and breathing exercises which is simple to learn and which can be practised even by the elderly had a markedly 'invigorating' effect on perceptions of both mental and physical energy and increased high positive mood. A more extensive investigation is planned to establish whether such a programme can readily be incorporated into everyday life, and with what long-term results.},

It thus gives an account of the evolution and current state of sponsorship research worldwide and points out new research directions. Over the past six years there have been clear advances in research into, and evaluation of, sponsorship effects and strategic sponsorship management. There has also been a notable shift towards a better understanding of how sponsorship is perceived by the end consumer. Overall, however, research is focused too much on consumer goods and service companies pursuing awareness and image objectives while engaged in sports sponsorship. Other types of institutions, other sponsorship objectives and other sponsorship areas are widely neglected. The same is true of the functional affiliation of sponsorship within the firms and sponsorship budgeting processes.},

abstract = {This study analyzes the effect of sponsorship announcements on the firm value of sponsoring firms by investigating whether sponsorship announcements have an influ- ence on abnormal returns on share prices. As previous research has neglected spon- sorships from different regions and the comparison of sponsorships in different sports, a unique dataset of sponsorship deals between 1999 and 2010 is created (n=629). Using event study methodology the data is analyzed for all sports in gener- al as well as for different sub-samples including soccer, motor sports, and different regions. The results of the event study provide evidence that sport sponsorship announcements positively impact stock returns, but this impact differs among sports and regions. The regression results reveal that abnormal returns are significantly higher for sponsorships on brand level, smaller firms, and deals with national reach. The findings have implications for corporate managers and sport managers as equi- librium prices for sponsorship deals have not yet been reached.},

The purpose of this study is to investigate the characteristics of triathlon participants and segment the overall market into smaller segments of consumers. Data on the behaviour, psychographics (lifestyle), and demographics of triathletes was collected by means of an online survey in Germany (n = 786). Lifestyle segmentation was undertaken using a k-means cluster analysis which suggested three clusters. They were labelled serious pursuiters, sport lovers, and socialisers depending on the activities and interests they have in their leisure time. The chi2-test revealed significant differences among clusters in terms of age, gender, years of participation, time of practice, and expenditure. The findings have implications for several stakeholders and allow them to specifically target different groups of triathlon participants.},

The propositions provide a basis for deducing a direct relationship between urbanization and dispersion of objects of consumption. The propositions were tested with data for 45 countries. The percentage of' the population residing in metropolitan areas was used as a measure of urbanization, an original measure of the diversification of industry was used as a gauge of division of labor, the per capital consumption of energy was taken as a measure of technological development, and an original measure of the dispersion of external resources was utilized. The degree of relationship was measured by the coefficient of rank- difference correlation. Positive results were obtained for all tests of the propositions.},
